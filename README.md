# CS 6350 Project Information
This project is a smaller piece of the greater SnowflakeID project I have been working on. For CS 6530, only the models in  the folder /habitModel/ have been developed for the project report. 
Data was also preprocessed in both the /data/ and /preprocessing/ folders. Image and classification data were not uploaded to GitHub due to size and the ongoing nature of the greater project.
